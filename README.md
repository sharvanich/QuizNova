# QuizNova

### 3. Quiz Summary & Rules

* Ensures users understand the quiz format and constraints.

### 4. Question Presentation

* Displayed **one at a time** for interactive answering.

This version is **clean, structured, and visually easy to follow**.

If you want, I can also **add badges, GIF preview of the app, and a ‚ÄúHow it looks‚Äù screenshot section** to make it look even more professional for GitHub.

Do you want me to do that next?
